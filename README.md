## Contributing

The Lightning-SDK is an open source project. If you want to contribute to it, please consider the following:

- the **main** branch is the latest stable release
- the **dev** branch is used for upcoming releases
- all development should be done in dedicated *topic branches* (from latest `dev`-branch)
- please send in your PR against the `dev`-branch

Before you submit your PR, make sure you install the projects dependencies, as this will activate automatic
linting and code formatting in a Git commit hook.
